# SearchForDoggos

This Site is for users to search for Dog breeds and some extra details related to them. This is for any users who are wanting to find a suiitabe dog to adopt. This website would be one of the suitable ones for them to go through all the type of dogs even including their picture, and users can decide on which breed is best for them.  

## Design Process

As the Title says "SearchForDoggos" it is a page for users to take a look at the different dogs and thier details. The homepage consist of nav bar  with 2 button (Home and Breed and Details) which brings you to the different pages.

 The Home page consist of a picture filled with chowchows, after hovering over the photos of the chowchow dogs, a bunch of text will appear which is a brief introduction of this website. and below it is a contact owner page (which does not work) but it is to contact me if they have any enquires about the informations. 
 
 Going to the Breeds and Details page, it appears a bunch of dogs including details under each pictures like "  Character No, Name, Life Span, Breed Group, Temperament.". 

Due to the long length of this page, i have added a back to top button by the bottom right so it makes it easier for users to go back to the top after scrolling down all the way to the bottom. 

The colours of this page is made to be bright and light to brighten up users mood when they come to use this page. there is a strong contrast between the colours of the text and the background so users do not spoil thier eyes when looking at the texts for too long.

## Future Features

In the future if possible i would like to work along together with pet shops and animal adoption centers to put thier contact numbers onto so that when users come across this website and find a suitable dog breed, the contacts of the centers are easily accessed by users to call or text to adopt or buy the dog.
